    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=B4:3E:A4:C0:0F:C8:35:D6:E8:07:06:D0:B0:A0:C2:16:F8:D2:BE:30%3Bcom.divyeshbc.NHSF

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    B4:3E:A4:C0:0F:C8:35:D6:E8:07:06:D0:B0:A0:C2:16:F8:D2:BE:30;com.divyeshbc.NHSF

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
